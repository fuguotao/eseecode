eSeeCode
========

**Educational programming language and graphic platform** for all ages from 3-years-old to **K12**, adapting to each age and level of knowledge.

The platform is free and open source and is available online at [http://www.eseecode.com](http://www.eseecode.com).

The platform offers **4 different views** of the code, being able to program from a pure **graphical** click-and-run interface to a pure **text** synthax highlighting editor, with two middle interfaces. This allows for a **smooth progress in programming learning** while keeping a common general interface, platform and instruction set, avoiding the need to learn a new language every now and then during the learning process.

The language is based on JavaScript (although this base is well hidden) so after mastering in Level4 the user can program freely on a real programming language like JavaScript.
