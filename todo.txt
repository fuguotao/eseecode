 * User manual
 * comments right before functionDeclaration should be resorted with them
 * icons should reflect when instruction parameter is a variable instead of a literal (for example: forward(a) )
 * uploadCode() should detect syntax errors: load code in level4 and highlight (take the chance to unify all code parsing into a single function common to all code uses)
 * follow-me of breakpoints
 * set up parameters in level2 graphically
